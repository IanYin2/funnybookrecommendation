# funnybookrecommendation
We encounter a variety of recommendation systems in our lives, such as music recommendation systems, book recommendation systems and movie recommendation systems. All these recommendation systems have the problem of transparency. In the case of book recommendation systems, they usually just give us the results of book recommendations without telling us why we received those recommendations. Recommendation systems use a variety of data about the user and are analyzed by algorithms. Users have the right to know which of their data is being used and in what way. This project adds a description of the recommendation algorithm and the data used to the book recommendation results, so that the user understands how their data is being used. In addition, this project adds a customized recommendation feature. Users can input their own requirements to get the recommended books actively.
